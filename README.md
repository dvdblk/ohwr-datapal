## TODO
* Data persistence (CoreData)
  * this tool was intended for small datasets
  * only a naive data persistence can be achieved in the current version. Use 'Import from JSON' while creating a new dataset.
* Various export formats / file formats (e.g. csv, [IAM style XML](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database/data-format))
